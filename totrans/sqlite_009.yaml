    by noted digital forensics expert, Paul Sanderson, provides investigators with
    low-level technical details useful in analysing SQLite database files.Every computer
    and phone uses hundreds of SQLite databases and there are over one trillion SQLite
    databases in active use. Hence, the importance of examining the data held in these
    databases in an investigation, including deleted data when possible, is paramount.
    This book fully explains the format of the SQLite database file. It shows how
    records are encoded, how to decode them manually and how to decode records that
    are partially overwritten. It also describe how the workings of SQLite, and in
    particular the journal and WAL, can be used to ascertain what has happened in
    a manner that cannot be determined from the data alone. The book covers basic
    SQL queries and how they can be used to create a custom report that includes data
    from different tables, and shows how one can use SQL queries to test hypotheses
    about the relationships of data in different tables.This book is aimed mainly
    at forensic practitioners, and it is assumed that the reader has some basic knowledge
    of computer forensics; it will also be of interest to computer professionals in
    general particularly those who have an interest in the SQLite file format. |'

    book starts with the architecture of SQLite database and introduces you to concepts
    in SQL. You will find yourself equipped to design your own database system, administer
    it, and maintain it. Further, you will learn how to operate your SQLite databases
    smoothly using SQL commands.You will be able to extend the functionality of SQLite
    by using its vast arsenal of C API calls to build some interesting, exciting,
    new, and intelligent data-driven applications. Understand how Xcode, HTML5, and
    Phonegap can be used to build a cross-platform modern app which can benefit from
    all these technologies - all through creating a complete, customizable application
    skeleton that you can build on for your own apps. This book provides a comprehensive
    description of SQLite database system. It describes design principles, engineering
    trade-offs, implementation issues, and operations of SQLite. |'

    enterprise computing, there is one database that enables a huge range of software
    and hardware to flex relational database capabilities, without the baggage and
    cost of traditional database management systems. That database is SQLite - an
    embeddable database with an amazingly small footprint, yet able to handle databases
    of enormous size. SQLite comes equipped with an array of powerful features available
    through a host of programming and development environments. It is supported by
    languages such as C, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, TCL, and more.*The Definitive
    Guide to SQLite, Second Edition* is devoted to complete coverage of the latest
    version of this powerful database. It offers a thorough overview of SQLite''s
    capabilities and APIs. The book also uses SQLite as the basis for helping newcomers
    make their first foray into database development. In only a short time you can
    be writing programs as diverse as a server-side browser plug-in or the next great
    iPhone or Android application! |'

    databases aren''t just for the IS group any more. You can build database-backed
    applications for the desktop, Web, embedded systems, or operating systems without
    linking to heavy-duty client-server databases such as Oracle and MySQL. This book
    shows how you to use SQLite, a small and lightweight database that you can build
    right into your application during development. Applications that handle data
    have an enormous advantage today, and with SQLite, you''ll discover how to develop
    a database-backed application that remains manageable in size and complexity.
    This book guides you every step of the way. You''ll get a crash course in data
    modeling, become familiar with SQLite''s dialect of the SQL database language,
    and learn how you to work with SQLite using either a scripting language or a C-based
    language, such as C# or Objective C.Now, even relatively small and nimble applications
    can be a part of the data revolution. Using SQLite shows you how. |'

    SQL ( Structured Query Language ) wird in Datenbanken zur Definition, Manipulation,

    Unabhaengig vom Betriebssystem oder aufwendigen, benutzerfreundlichen, graphischen
    Oberflaechen bleibt die Logik aber immer gleich.SQLite ist eine freie Desktop-Datenbank,
    sie kostet nichts, ist fuer viele Betriebssysteme verfuegbar, schnell heruntergeladen

    die besten Voraussetzungen, ohne viel Aufwand schnell in die Welt der Datenbanken
    und Datenbanksprache reinzuschnuppern.Wer nach den Uebungen aber auf den Geschmack
    gekommen ist, hat schon den groessten Teil an Datenbanken und SQL gelernt, denn
    alles Besprochene ist Wissen, welches auch auf jedes andere der vielen Datenbanken

    and a few other operating systems. It has been widely used in low-to-medium tier
    database applications. This Short Cut discusses design principles, engineering
    trade-offs, implementation issues, and operations of SQLite. It presents a comprehensive
