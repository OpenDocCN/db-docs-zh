- en: Below is a simple [TCL program](http://www.tcl-lang.org) that demonstrates how
    to use the TCL interface to SQLite. The program executes the SQL statements given
    as the second argument on the database defined by the first argument. The commands
    to watch for are the **sqlite3** command on line 7 which opens an SQLite database
    and creates a new object named "**db**" to access that database, the use of the
    [eval method](tclsqlite.html#eval) on the **db** object on line 8 to run SQL commands
    against the database, and the closing of the database connection on the last line
    of the script.

- en: Below is a simple C program that demonstrates how to use the [C/C++ interface](c3ref/intro.html)
    to SQLite. The name of a database is given by the first argument and the second
    argument is one or more SQL statements to execute against the database. The function
    calls to pay attention to here are the call to [sqlite3_open()](c3ref/open.html)
    on line 22 which opens the database, [sqlite3_exec()](c3ref/exec.html) on line
    28 that executes SQL commands against the database, and [sqlite3_close()](c3ref/close.html)
    on line 33 that closes the database connection.
