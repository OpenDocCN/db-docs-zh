- en: The [underlying file format](fileformat2.html) for SQLite databases does not
    change in incompatible ways. There are literally trillions of SQLite database
    files in circulation and the SQLite developers are committing to supporting those
    files for decades into the future.

- en: Prior to SQLite version 3.0.0 (2004-06-18), the file format did sometimes change
    from one release to the next. But since that time, the file format has been fully
    backwards compatible.

- en: By "backwards compatible" we mean that newer versions of SQLite can always read
    and write database files created by older versions of SQLite. It is often also
    the case that SQLite is "forwards compatible", that older versions of SQLite can
    read and write database files created by newer versions of SQLite. But there are
    sometimes forward compatibility breaks. Sometimes new features are added to the
    file format. For example, [WAL mode](wal.html) was added in version 3.7.0 (2010-07-21).
    SQLite 3.7.0 and later can read and write all database files created by earlier
    versions of SQLite. And earlier versions of SQLite can read and write database
    files created by SQLite 3.7.0 and later *as long as the database does not use
    WAL mode*. But versions of SQLite prior to version 3.7.0 cannot read nor write
    SQLite database files that make use of WAL mode.

    created by newer versions of SQLite as long as the database does not make use
    of newer features that are unknown to that older version.
