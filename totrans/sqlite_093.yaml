- en: The SQLite library is a core part of the Android environment. Java applications
    and content providers access SQLite using the interface in the [android.database.sqlite](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteDatabase.html)
    namespace.

- en: For most applications, this is convenient and works well. However, it means
    that applications must be content with the SQLite version and build installed
    on the target device as part of the operating system. If your application happens
    to require a newer version of SQLite, or a build with a custom extension or [VFS](http://www.sqlite.org/vfs.html)
    installed, you're out of luck.

- en: One solution is to bundle the SQLite library directly into the application,
    bypassing the version built-in to Android. This project, the *SQLite Android bindings*,
    provides an easy way to do just that. This allows an application to use a custom
    build or version of SQLite, regardless of the Android version to which it is deployed,
    while continuing to use the standard Android interface.
