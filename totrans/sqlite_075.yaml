    than the same blobs can be read from or written to individual files on disk using
    fread() or fwrite().

    less disk space than storing the blobs in individual files.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The performance difference arises (we believe) because when working from an
    SQLite database, the open() and close() system calls are invoked only once, whereas
    open() and close() are invoked once for each blob when using blobs stored in individual
    files. It appears that the overhead of calling open() and close() is greater than
    the overhead of using the database. The size reduction arises from the fact that
    individual files are padded out to the next multiple of the filesystem block size,
    whereas the blobs are packed more tightly into an SQLite database.

    fluctuations on real-world hardware. See the text below for more detail. Try the

    easily at hand. Some reviewers of this article report that SQLite has higher latency
    than direct I/O on their systems. We do not yet understand the difference. We
    also see indications that SQLite does not perform as well as direct I/O when experiments
    are run using a cold filesystem cache.

    studied the read performance of BLOBs versus file I/O for Microsoft SQL Server
    and found that reading BLOBs out of the database was faster for BLOB sizes less
    than between 250KiB and 1MiB. ([Paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/to-blob-or-not-to-blob-large-object-storage-in-a-database-or-a-filesystem/)).
    In that study, the database still stores the filename of the content even if the
    content is held in a separate file. So the database is consulted for every BLOB,
    even if it is only to extract the filename. In this article, the key for the BLOB
    is the filename, so no preliminary database access is required. Because the database
    is never used at all when reading content from individual files in this article,
    the threshold at which direct file I/O becomes faster is smaller than it is in
    Gray''s paper.'

    statements. This helps SQLite to run a little faster on read tests. You can omit

    Use the --multitrans option to run each blob read or write in a separate transaction.

    disk I/O. This option proves, yet again, that to get the most performance out
    of SQLite, you should group as much database interaction as possible within a
