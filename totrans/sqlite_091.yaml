- en: If the application or host computer crashes before the transaction completes,
    then the rollback journal or write-ahead log contains information needed to restore
    the main database file to a consistent state. When a rollback journal or write-ahead
    log contains information necessary for recovering the state of the database, they
    are called a "hot journal" or "hot WAL file". Hot journals and WAL files are only
    a factor during error recovery scenarios and so are uncommon, but they are part
    of the state of an SQLite database and so cannot be ignored. This document defines
    the format of a rollback journal and the write-ahead log file, but the focus is
    on the main database file.

    a power of two between 512 and 65536 inclusive. All pages within the same database
    are the same size. The page size for a database file is determined by the 2-byte
    integer located at an offset of 16 bytes from the beginning of the database file.

    (2^(32) - 2). The minimum size SQLite database is a single 512-byte page. The
    maximum size database would be 4294967294 pages at 65536 bytes per page or 281,474,976,579,584
    bytes (about 281 terabytes). Usually SQLite will hit the maximum file size limit
    of the underlying filesystem or disk hardware long before it hits its own internal
    size limit.

    Beginning with SQLite [version 3.7.1](releaselog/3_7_1.html) (2010-08-23), a page
    size of 65536 bytes is supported. The value 65536 will not fit in a two-byte integer,
    so to specify a 65536-byte page size, the value at offset 16 is 0x00 0x01. This
    value can be interpreted as a big-endian 1 and thought of as a magic number to
    represent the 65536 page size. Or one can view the two-byte field as a little
    endian number and say that it represents the page size divided by 256\. These
    two interpretations of the page-size field are equivalent.

    of SQLite. In current versions of SQLite, both of these values are 1 for rollback
    journalling modes and 2 for [WAL](wal.html) journalling mode. If a version of
    SQLite coded to the current file format specification encounters a database file
    where the read version is 1 or 2 but the write version is greater than 2, then
    the database file must be treated as read-only. If a database file with a read

    of every page for use by extensions. These extra bytes are used, for example,
    by the SQLite Encryption Extension to store a nonce and/or cryptographic checksum
    associated with each page. The "reserved space" size in the 1-byte integer at
    offset 20 is the number of bytes of space at the end of each page to reserve for
    extensions. This value is usually 0\. The value can be odd.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    integer at offset 16 in the header less the "reserved" space size recorded in
    the 1-byte integer at offset 20 in the header. The usable size of a page might
    be an odd number. However, the usable size is not allowed to be less than 480\.
    In other words, if the page size is 512, then the reserved space size cannot exceed
    32.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The file change counter is a 4-byte big-endian integer at offset 24 that is
    incremented whenever the database file is unlocked after having been modified.
    When two or more processes are reading the same database file, each process can
    detect database changes from other processes by monitoring the change counter.
    A process will normally want to flush its database page cache when another process
    modified the database, since the cache has become stale. The file change counter
    facilitates this.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the change counter is not needed. Hence, the change counter might not be incremented
    on each transaction in WAL mode.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The 4-byte big-endian integer at offset 28 into the header stores the size of
    the database file in pages. If this in-header datasize size is not valid (see
    the next paragraph), then the database size is computed by looking at the actual
    size of the database file. Older versions of SQLite ignored the in-header database
    size and used the actual file size exclusively. Newer versions of SQLite use the
    in-header database size if it is available but fall back to the actual file size
    if the in-header database size is not valid.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The in-header database size is only considered to be valid if it is non-zero
    and if the 4-byte [change counter](fileformat2.html#chngctr) at offset 24 exactly
    matches the 4-byte [version-valid-for number](fileformat2.html#validfor) at offset
    92. The in-header database size is always valid when the database is only modified
    using recent versions of SQLite, versions 3.7.0 (2010-07-21) and later. If a legacy
    version of SQLite writes to the database, it will not know to update the in-header
    database size and so the in-header database size could be incorrect. But legacy
    versions of SQLite will also leave the version-valid-for number at offset 92 unchanged
    so it will not match the change-counter. Hence, invalid in-header database sizes
    can be detected (and ignored) by observing when the change-counter does not match
    the version-valid-for number.

    statement must be reprepared. When a prepared statement runs, it first checks
    the schema cookie to ensure the value is the same as when the statement was prepared

    on page-oriented storage devices. For background information on b-trees, see Knuth,
    The Art Of Computer Programming, Volume 3 "Sorting and Searching", pages 471-479\.
    Two variants of b-trees are used by SQLite. "Table b-trees" use a 64-bit signed
    integer key and store all data in the leaves. "Index b-trees" use arbitrary keys
    and store no data at all.

- en: A b-tree page is either an interior page or a leaf page. A leaf page contains
    keys and in the case of a table b-tree each key has associated data. An interior
    page contains K keys together with K+1 pointers to child b-tree pages. A "pointer"
    in an interior b-tree page is just the 32-bit unsigned integer page number of
    the child page.
  prefs: []

- en: The number of keys on an interior b-tree page, K, is almost always at least
    2 and is usually much more than 2. The only exception is when page 1 is an interior
    b-tree page. Page 1 has 100 fewer bytes of storage space available, due to the
    presence of the database header at the beginning of that page, and so sometimes
    (rarely) if page 1 is an interior b-tree page, it can end up holding just a single
    key. In all other cases, K is 2 or more. The upper bound on K is as many keys
    as will fit on the page. Large keys on index b-trees are split up into [overflow
    pages](fileformat2.html#ovflpgs) so that no single key uses more than one fourth
    of the available storage space on the page and hence every internal page is able
    to store at least 4 keys. The integer keys of table b-trees are never large enough
    to require overflow, so key overflow only occurs on index b-trees.

    pointer on both ends. (The previous sentence is to be understood conceptually
    - the actual layout of the keys and pointers within the page is more complicated
    and will be described in the sequel.) All keys within the same page are unique
    and are logically organized in ascending order from left to right. (Again, this
    ordering is logical, not physical. The actual location of keys within the page
    is arbitrary.) For any key X, pointers to the left of a X refer to b-tree pages
    on which all keys are less than or equal to X. Pointers to the right of X refer
    to pages where all keys are greater than X.

    are combined into a structure called a "cell". The right-most pointer is held
    separately. A leaf b-tree page has no pointers, but it still uses the cell structure
    to hold keys for index b-trees or keys and content for table b-trees. Data is
    also contained in the cell.

    a parent is called a root page. A root b-tree page together with the closure of
    its children form a complete b-tree. It is possible (and in fact rather common)
    to have a complete b-tree that consists of a single page that is both a leaf and
    the root. Because there are pointers from parents to children, every page of a
    complete b-tree can be located if only the root page is known. Hence, b-trees
    are identified by their root page number.

    When an SQL table includes an [INTEGER PRIMARY KEY](lang_createtable.html#rowid)
    column (which aliases the [rowid](lang_createtable.html#rowid)) then that column
    appears in the record as a NULL value. SQLite will always use the table b-tree

    an index b-tree rather than a table b-tree for storage. The key for each entry
    in the WITHOUT ROWID b-tree is a record composed of the columns of the PRIMARY
    KEY followed by all remaining columns of the table. The primary key columns appear

    Transactions commit when a frame is written that contains a commit marker. A single
    WAL can and usually does record multiple transactions. Periodically, the content
    of the WAL is transferred back into the database file in an operation called a
    "checkpoint".

    this recorded mxFrame value for all subsequent read operations. New transactions
    can be appended to the WAL, but as long as the reader uses its original mxFrame
    value and ignores subsequently appended content, the reader will see a consistent
    snapshot of the database from a single point in time. This technique allows multiple
    concurrent readers to view different versions of the database content simultaneously.

    does not support [journal_mode=WAL](pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode) on a network
    filesystem when clients are on different machines, as all clients of the database
    must be able to share the same memory.

    4.4](fileformat2.html#walread) that is read at the start of a transaction and
    which defines the maximum frame from the WAL that the reader will use.

- en: The wal-index is transient. After a crash, the wal-index is reconstructed from
    the original WAL file. The VFS is required to either truncate or zero the header
    of the wal-index when the last connection to it closes. Because the wal-index
    is transient, it can use an architecture-specific format; it does not have to
    be cross-platform. Hence, unlike the database and WAL file formats which store
    all values as big endian, the wal-index stores multi-byte values in the native
    byte order of the host computer.

    since the wal-index is a transient structure, no further information about the
    format of the wal-index will be provided here. Additional details on the format
    of the wal-index are contained in the separate [WAL-index File Format](walformat.html#walidxfmt)
    document.
