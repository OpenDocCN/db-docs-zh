    that bytecode using a virtual machine.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The [sqlite3_prepare_v2()](c3ref/prepare.html) and related interfaces act as
    a compiler for converting SQL text into bytecode. The [sqlite3_stmt](c3ref/stmt.html)
    object is a container for a single bytecode program that implements a single SQL
    statement. The [sqlite3_step()](c3ref/step.html) interface passes a bytecode program
    into the virtual machine, and runs the program until it either completes, or forms
    a row of result to be returned, or hits a fatal error, or is [interrupted](c3ref/interrupt.html).

    [main.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/main.c), [legacy.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/legacy.c),
    and [vdbeapi.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/vdbeapi.c) though some routines
    are scattered about in other files where they can have access to data structures
    with file scope. The [sqlite3_get_table()](c3ref/free_table.html) routine is implemented
    in [table.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/table.c). The [sqlite3_mprintf()](c3ref/mprintf.html)
    routine is found in [printf.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/printf.c). The
    [sqlite3_complete()](c3ref/complete.html) interface is in [complete.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/complete.c).
    The [TCL Interface](tclsqlite.html) is implemented by [tclsqlite.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/tclsqlite.c).

    with the prefix **sqlite3**. Those symbols that are intended for external use
    (in other words, those symbols which form the API for SQLite) add an underscore,
    and thus begin with **sqlite3_**. Extension APIs sometimes add the extension name
    prior to the underscore; for example: **sqlite3rbu_** or **sqlite3session_**.'

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When a string containing SQL statements is to be evaluated it is first sent
    to the tokenizer. The tokenizer breaks the SQL text into tokens and hands those
    tokens one by one to the parser. The tokenizer is hand-coded in the file <file>tokenize.c.</file>
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note that in this design, the tokenizer calls the parser. People who are familiar
    with YACC and BISON may be accustomed to doing things the other way around — having
    the parser call the tokenizer. Having the tokenizer call the parser is better,
    though, because it can be made threadsafe and it runs faster.

- en: Parser
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The parser assigns meaning to tokens based on their context. The parser for
    SQLite is generated using the [Lemon parser generator](lemon.html). Lemon does
    the same job as YACC/BISON, but it uses a different input syntax which is less
    error-prone. Lemon also generates a parser which is reentrant and thread-safe.
    And Lemon defines the concept of a non-terminal destructor so that it does not
    leak memory when syntax errors are encountered. The grammar file that drives Lemon
    and that defines the SQL language that SQLite understands is found in [parse.y](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/parse.y).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because Lemon is a program not normally found on development machines, the complete
    source code to Lemon (just one C file) is included in the SQLite distribution
    in the "tool" subdirectory.

- en: 'After the parser assembles tokens into a parse tree, the code generator runs
    to analyze the parse tree and generate [bytecode](opcode.html) that performs the
    work of the SQL statement. The [prepared statement](c3ref/stmt.html) object is
    a container for this bytecode. There are many files in the code generator, including:
    [attach.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/attach.c), [auth.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/auth.c),
    [build.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/build.c), [delete.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/delete.c),

    In these files is where most of the serious magic happens. [expr.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/expr.c)
    handles code generation for expressions. **where*.c** handles code generation
    for WHERE clauses on SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE statements. The files [attach.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/attach.c),

    [update.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/update.c), and [vacuum.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/vacuum.c)
    handle the code generation for SQL statements with the same names. (Each of these
    files calls routines in [expr.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/expr.c) and [where.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/where.c)
    as necessary.) All other SQL statements are coded out of [build.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/build.c).

    SQL statement, there might be hundreds, thousands, or millions of different algorithms
    to compute the answer. The query planner is an AI that strives to select the best
    algorithm from these millions of choices.

    The [vdbe.h](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/vdbe.h) header file defines an interface
    between the virtual machine and the rest of the SQLite library and [vdbeInt.h](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/vdbeInt.h)
    which defines structures and interfaces that are private to the virtual machine
    itself. Various other **vdbe*.c** files are helpers to the virtual machine. The
    [vdbeaux.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/vdbeaux.c) file contains utilities
    used by the virtual machine and interface modules used by the rest of the library
    to construct VM programs. The [vdbeapi.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/vdbeapi.c)
    file contains external interfaces to the virtual machine such as the [sqlite3_bind_int()](c3ref/bind_blob.html)

    default [page_size](pragma.html#pragma_page_size) is 4096 bytes but can be any
    power of two between 512 and 65536 bytes. The page cache is responsible for reading,
    writing, and caching these pages. The page cache also provides the rollback and
    atomic commit abstraction and takes care of locking of the database file. The
    B-tree driver requests particular pages from the page cache and notifies the page
    cache when it wants to modify pages or commit or rollback changes. The page cache
    handles all the messy details of making sure the requests are handled quickly,
    safely, and efficiently.

    the current time, or obtaining randomness to initialize the built-in pseudo-random
    number generator. SQLite currently provides VFSes for unix (in the [os_unix.c](https://sqlite.org/src/file/src/os_unix.c)
