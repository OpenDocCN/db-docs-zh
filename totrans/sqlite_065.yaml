- en: The output is a human-readable ASCII text report that provides information on
    the space utilization of the database file. The report is intended to be self-explanatory,
    though there is some [additional explanation](sqlanalyze.html#defs) of the various
    parameters reported toward the end of the report.

- en: The output is also valid SQL. Most of the report text is contained within a
    header comment, with various SQL statements that create and initialize a database
    at the [end of the report](sqlanalyze.html#sqlx). The constructed database contains
    the raw data from which the report was extracted. Hence the original report can
    be read into an instance of the [command-line shell](cli.html) and then the raw
    data can be queried to dig deeper into the space utilization of a particular database
    file.

    uses the [dbstat virtual table](dbstat.html) to gather information about the database
    file and then format that information neatly.
