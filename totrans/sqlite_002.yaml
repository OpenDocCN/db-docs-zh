- en: SQLite is an in-process library that implements a [self-contained](selfcontained.html),
    [serverless](serverless.html), [zero-configuration](zeroconf.html), [transactional](transactional.html)
    SQL database engine. The code for SQLite is in the [public domain](copyright.html)
    and is thus free for use for any purpose, commercial or private. SQLite is the
    [most widely deployed](mostdeployed.html) database in the world with more applications
    than we can count, including several [high-profile projects.](famous.html)

- en: SQLite is an embedded SQL database engine. Unlike most other SQL databases,
    SQLite does not have a separate server process. SQLite reads and writes directly
    to ordinary disk files. A complete SQL database with multiple tables, indices,
    triggers, and views, is contained in a single disk file. The database [file format](fileformat2.html)
    is cross-platform - you can freely copy a database between 32-bit and 64-bit systems
    or between [big-endian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness) and [little-endian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness)
    architectures. These features make SQLite a popular choice as an [Application
    File Format](appfileformat.html). SQLite database files are a [recommended storage
    format](locrsf.html) by the US Library of Congress. Think of SQLite not as a replacement
    for [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/database/index.html) but as a replacement for
    [fopen()](http://man.he.net/man3/fopen)

- en: SQLite is a compact library. With all features enabled, the [library size](footprint.html)
    can be less than 750KiB, depending on the target platform and compiler optimization
    settings. (64-bit code is larger. And some compiler optimizations such as aggressive
    function inlining and loop unrolling can cause the object code to be much larger.)
    There is a tradeoff between memory usage and speed. SQLite generally runs faster
    the more memory you give it. Nevertheless, performance is usually quite good even
    in low-memory environments. Depending on how it is used, SQLite can be [faster
    than direct filesystem I/O](fasterthanfs.html).

- en: SQLite is [very carefully tested](testing.html) prior to every release and has
    a reputation for being very reliable. Most of the SQLite source code is devoted
    purely to testing and verification. An automated test suite runs millions and
    millions of test cases involving hundreds of millions of individual SQL statements
    and achieves [100% branch test coverage](testing.html#coverage). SQLite responds
    gracefully to memory allocation failures and disk I/O errors. Transactions are
    [ACID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) even if interrupted by system crashes
    or power failures. All of this is verified by the automated tests using special
    test harnesses which simulate system failures. Of course, even with all this testing,
    there are still bugs. But unlike some similar projects (especially commercial
    competitors) SQLite is open and honest about all bugs and provides [bugs lists](https://www.sqlite.org/src/rptview?rn=1)
    and minute-by-minute [chronologies](https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline) of code
    changes.

- en: The SQLite code base is supported by an [international team](crew.html) of developers
    who work on SQLite full-time. The developers continue to expand the capabilities
    of SQLite and enhance its reliability and performance while maintaining backwards
    compatibility with the [published interface spec](c3ref/intro.html), [SQL syntax](lang.html),
    and database [file format](fileformat2.html). The source code is absolutely free
    to anybody who wants it, but [professional support](prosupport.html) is also available.

    The future is always hard to predict, but the intent of the developers is to support
    SQLite through the year 2050\. Design decisions are made with that objective in
    mind.

    it well: to make good and beautiful products that are fast, reliable, and simple
    to use. Seek forgiveness for yourself as you forgive others. And just as you have
    received SQLite for free, so also freely give, paying the debt forward.'
