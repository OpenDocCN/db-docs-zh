- en: Group Replication’s failure detection mechanism is a distributed service which
    is able to identify that a server in the group is not communicating with the others,
    and is therefore suspected of being out of service. If the group’s consensus is
    that the suspicion is probably true, the group takes a coordinated decision to
    expel the member. Expelling a member that is not communicating is necessary because
    the group needs a majority of its members to agree on a transaction or view change.
    If a member is not participating in these decisions, the group must remove it
    to increase the chance that the group contains a majority of correctly working
    members, and can therefore continue to process transactions.

  zh: Group Replication的故障检测机制是一个分布式服务，能够识别组中的服务器是否与其他服务器通信，因此被怀疑处于停机状态。如果组的共识是怀疑可能是真实的，组将协调决定将该成员驱逐。驱逐一个不通信的成员是必要的，因为组需要大多数成员就交易或视图更改达成一致。如果一个成员不参与这些决定，组必须将其移除，以增加组中包含大多数正常工作成员的机会，从而可以继续处理交易。
- en: In a replication group, each member has a point-to-point communication channel
    to each other member, creating a fully connected graph. These connections are
    managed by the group communication engine (XCom, a Paxos variant) and use TCP/IP
    sockets. One channel is used to send messages to the member and the other channel
    is used to receive messages from the member. If a member does not receive messages
    from another member for 5 seconds, it suspects that the member has failed, and
    lists the status of that member as `UNREACHABLE` in its own Performance Schema
    table [`replication_group_members`](performance-schema-replication-group-members-table.html
    "29.12.11.11 The replication_group_members Table"). Usually, two members will
    suspect each other of having failed because they are each not communicating with
    the other. It is possible, though less likely, that member A suspects member B
    of having failed but member B does not suspect member A of having failed - perhaps
    due to a routing or firewall issue. A member can also create a suspicion of itself.
    A member that is isolated from the rest of the group suspects that all the others
    have failed.

  zh: 在复制组中，每个成员与其他成员之间都有一条点对点通信通道，形成一个完全连接的图。这些连接由组通信引擎（XCom，一种Paxos变体）管理，并使用TCP/IP套接字。一个通道用于向成员发送消息，另一个通道用于接收来自成员的消息。如果一个成员在5秒内没有收到来自另一个成员的消息，它会怀疑该成员已经失败，并在自己的性能模式表[`replication_group_members`](performance-schema-replication-group-members-table.html
    "29.12.11.11 The replication_group_members Table")中将该成员的状态列为`UNREACHABLE`。通常，两个成员会互相怀疑对方已经失败，因为它们彼此之间没有通信。但也有可能，尽管不太可能，成员A怀疑成员B已经失败，但成员B并没有怀疑成员A已经失败
    - 可能是由于路由或防火墙问题。一个成员也可以怀疑自己。一个与组其他成员隔离的成员怀疑所有其他成员已经失败。
- en: If a suspicion lasts for more than 10 seconds, the suspecting member tries to
    propagate its view that the suspect member is faulty to the other members of the
    group. A suspecting member only does this if it is a notifier, as calculated from
    its internal XCom node number. If a member is actually isolated from the rest
    of the group, it might attempt to propagate its view, but that will have no consequences
    as it cannot secure a quorum of the other members to agree on it. A suspicion
    only has consequences if a member is a notifier, and its suspicion lasts long
    enough to be propagated to the other members of the group, and the other members
    agree on it. In that case, the suspect member is marked for expulsion from the
    group in a coordinated decision, and is expelled after the waiting period set
    by the [`group_replication_member_expel_timeout`](group-replication-system-variables.html#sysvar_group_replication_member_expel_timeout)
    system variable expires and the expelling mechanism detects and implements the
    expulsion.

  zh: 如果一个怀疑持续超过10秒，怀疑的成员会试图向组内其他成员传播其观点，即怀疑的成员有缺陷。只有当怀疑的成员是通知者时才会这样做，这是从其内部XCom节点编号计算出来的。如果一个成员实际上与组的其他成员隔离开来，它可能会尝试传播其观点，但这不会产生任何后果，因为它无法获得其他成员的多数同意。只有当一个成员是通知者时，怀疑持续时间足够长以传播到组的其他成员，并且其他成员同意时，怀疑才会产生后果。在这种情况下，怀疑的成员被标记为从组中驱逐，在[`group_replication_member_expel_timeout`](group-replication-system-variables.html#sysvar_group_replication_member_expel_timeout)系统变量设置的等待期过后，驱逐机制检测到并实施驱逐后被驱逐。
- en: Where the network is unstable and members frequently lose and regain connection
    to each other in different combinations, it is theoretically possible for a group
    to end up marking all its members for expulsion, after which the group would cease
    to exist and have to be set up again. To counter this possibility, from MySQL
    8.0.20, Group Replication's Group Communication System (GCS) tracks the group
    members that have been marked for expulsion, and treats them as if they were in
    the group of suspected members when deciding if there is a majority. This ensures
    at least one member remains in the group and the group can continue to exist.
    When an expelled member has actually been removed from the group, GCS removes
    its record of having marked the member for expulsion, so that the member can rejoin
    the group if it is able to.

  zh: 在网络不稳定且成员经常在不同组合中失去和重新建立连接的情况下，理论上可能导致一个组标记所有成员进行驱逐，之后该组将停止存在并需要重新设置。为了应对这种可能性，从MySQL
    8.0.20开始，Group Replication的Group Communication System (GCS)跟踪已被标记为驱逐的组成员，并在决定是否存在多数时将其视为被怀疑成员的组。这确保至少有一个成员留在组内，使组能够继续存在。当一个被驱逐的成员实际上已被从组中移除时，GCS将删除其被标记为驱逐的记录，以便该成员可以重新加入组（如果有可能）。
