- en: The joining member begins by checking the relay log for its `group_replication_applier`
    channel for any transactions that it already received from the group but did not
    yet apply. If the joining member was in the group previously, it might find unapplied
    transactions from before it left, in which case it applies these as a first step.
    A member that is new to the group does not have anything to apply.

  zh: 加入成员首先通过检查其`group_replication_applier`通道的中继日志，查看组中已接收但尚未应用的任何事务。如果加入成员以前曾在组中，它可能会发现在离开之前未应用的事务，这种情况下会将其作为第一步应用。新加入组的成员没有任何需要应用的事务。
- en: After this, the joining member connects to an online existing member to carry
    out state transfer. The joining member transfers all the transactions that took
    place in the group before it joined or while it was away, which are provided by
    the existing member (called the *donor*). Next, the joining member applies the
    transactions that took place in the group while this state transfer was in progress.
    When this process is complete, the joining member has caught up with the remaining
    servers in the group, and it begins to participate normally in the group.

    for state transfer after you issue [`START GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.html
    "15.4.3.1 START GROUP_REPLICATION Statement") on the joining member. To do this,
    Group Replication checks which existing members are suitable as donors, how many
    transactions the joining member needs from a donor, and whether any required transactions
    are no longer present in the binary log files on any group member. If the transaction
    gap between the joining member and a suitable donor is large, or if some required
    transactions are not in any donor's binary log files, Group Replication begins
    distributed recovery with a remote cloning operation. If there is not a large
    transaction gap, or if the clone plugin is not installed, Group Replication proceeds
    directly to state transfer from a donor's binary log.

  zh: 在加入成员上发出[`START GROUP_REPLICATION`](start-group-replication.html "15.4.3.1 START
    GROUP_REPLICATION Statement")后，组复制会自动选择这些方法的最佳组合进行状态转移。为此，组复制会检查哪些现有成员适合作为捐赠者，加入成员需要从捐赠者那里获取多少事务，以及是否在任何组成员的二进制日志文件中不再存在任何必需的事务。如果加入成员与适当的捐赠者之间的事务差距很大，或者某些必需的事务不在任何捐赠者的二进制日志文件中，组复制将开始进行远程克隆操作的分布式恢复。如果事务差距不大，或者未安装克隆插件，则组复制直接进行从捐赠者的二进制日志进行状态转移。
- en: During a remote cloning operation, the existing data on the joining member is
    removed, and replaced with a copy of the donor's data. When the remote cloning
    operation is complete and the joining member has restarted, state transfer from

    while the remote cloning operation was in progress.

- en: During state transfer from a donor's binary log, the joining member replicates
    and applies the required transactions from the donor's binary log, applying the
    transactions as they are received, up to the point where the binary log records
    that the joining member joined the group (a view change event). While this is
    in progress, the joining member buffers the new transactions that the group applies.
    When state transfer from the binary log is complete, the joining member applies
    the buffered transactions.

  zh: 提示
- en: State transfer from the binary log is Group Replication's base mechanism for
    distributed recovery, and if the donors and joining members in your replication
    group are not set up to support cloning, this is the only available option. As
    state transfer from the binary log is based on classic asynchronous replication,
    it might take a very long time if the server joining the group does not have the
    group's data at all, or has data taken from a very old backup image. In this situation,
    it is therefore recommended that before adding a server to the group, you should
    set it up with the group's data by transferring a fairly recent snapshot of a
    server already in the group. This minimizes the time taken for distributed recovery,
    and reduces the impact on donor servers, since they have to retain and transfer
    fewer binary log files.

  zh: 从二进制日志进行状态转移是组复制的分布式恢复的基本机制，如果您的复制组中的捐赠者和加入成员未设置为支持克隆，则这是唯一可用的选项。由于从二进制日志进行状态转移是基于经典的异步复制，如果加入组的服务器根本没有组的数据，或者具有来自非常旧的备份镜像的数据，可能需要很长时间。因此，在将服务器添加到组之前，建议您通过传输一个相当新的服务器快照来设置具有组数据的服务器。这样可以最大程度地减少分布式恢复所需的时间，并减少对捐赠者服务器的影响，因为它们需要保留和传输更少的二进制日志文件。
