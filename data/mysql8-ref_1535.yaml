- en: Based on the metrics gathered across all servers in the group, a throttling
    mechanism kicks in and decides whether to limit the rate a member is able to execute/commit
    new transactions.

  zh: 基于在组中所有服务器收集的指标，限流机制会启动并决定是否限制成员能够执行/提交新事务的速率。
- en: 'Therefore, metrics acquired from all members are the basis for calculating
    the capacity of each member: if a member has a large queue (for certification
    or the applier thread), then the capacity to execute new transactions should be
    close to ones certified or applied in the last period.'

  zh: 因此，从所有成员获取的指标是计算每个成员容量的基础：如果成员有一个大队列（用于认证或应用程序线程），那么执行新事务的能力应该接近上个周期认证或应用的事务。
- en: The lowest capacity of all the members in the group determines the real capacity
    of the group, while the number of local transactions determines how many members
    are writing to it, and, consequently, how many members should that available capacity
    be shared with.

  zh: 组中所有成员的最低容量确定了组的实际容量，而本地事务的数量确定了有多少成员正在向其写入，因此，可用容量应该与多少成员共享。
- en: This means that every member has an established write quota based on the available
    capacity, in other words a number of transactions it can safely issue for the
    next period. The writer-quota is enforced by the throttling mechanism if the queue
    size of the certifier or the binary log applier exceeds a user-defined threshold.

  zh: 这意味着每个成员都有一个根据可用容量确定的已建立的写入配额，换句话说，它可以安全地为下一个周期发出的事务数量。如果认证者或二进制日志应用程序的队列大小超过用户定义的阈值，写入配额将由限流机制执行。
- en: The quota is reduced by the number of transactions that were delayed in the
    last period, and then also further reduced by 10% to allow the queue that triggered
    the problem to reduce its size. In order to avoid large jumps in throughput once
    the queue size goes beyond the threshold, the throughput is only allowed to grow
    by the same 10% per period after that.

  zh: 配额将减少上个周期延迟的事务数量，然后再减少10%，以允许触发问题的队列减小其大小。为了避免一旦队列大小超过阈值就出现大幅增加的吞吐量，吞吐量在此后每个周期只允许增长相同的10%。
- en: The current throttling mechanism does not penalize transactions below quota,
    but delays finishing those transactions that exceed it until the end of the monitoring
    period. As a consequence, if the quota is very small for the write requests issued
    some transactions may have latencies close to the monitoring period.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 当前的限流机制不会对低于配额的事务进行惩罚，但会延迟完成那些超出配额的事务，直到监控周期结束。因此，如果写请求的配额非常小，一些事务的延迟可能接近监控周期。
